# Preparing for components (Deliverables) 

There is a reasonable chance that you've had some experience with the Bootstrap CSS library.  Following what chapter one (and a lecture on that chapter) discusses about JavaScript components in React, let's develop a UI and highlight/identify where components will come in handy.  Using a tool like Lucid Chart (or whatever you'd care to use) create a wireframe of a user interface for the following use case: 

You have an app UI that lets you order a pizza from the lowest bidder from among local pizza delivery restaurants.  In order to do this, only a set number of topping combinations and sizes are permitted.  The user should be able to select from pre-set combinations and sizes.  Then, whichever local pizza deliver restaurant has the lowest price will automatically confirm the delivery and indicate this on the app screen.  The user should be able to setup an account easily with just email, password, and method of payment. 

You will provide two deliverables: 

    An image of your wireframe 

    A mockup utilizing Bootstrap 4.x 

Submission

    Push all code and images to a Github repository and provide me with the URL of your repository (if it is private, I need access - ahuimanu is my username)
